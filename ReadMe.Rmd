## STUDY AND SITE INFROMATION
The study is conducted along an elevational gradient ranging from sub-alpine to alpine meadows in the Hengduan Mountain of southwest China. The elevational gradient contains of four sites: lowland (L 3000m), middle (M 3500m), alpine (A 3850m) and high alpine (H 4100m).

  site      lat     long
1    L 29.84347 102.0343
2    M 29.86192 102.0360
3    A 29.88911 102.0173
4    H 29.90742 102.0118

## Experiments
Each site is divded into 5 (H) - 7 blocks within a fence to protect the site from grazing. Each block contains up to 7 different plots: OTC (open top chamber), C (untouched control), 0 (local transplant), 1 (transplant one step down, warm1), 2 (transplant one step up, cold1), 3 (transplant all the way down, warm3), 4 (transplant all the way up, cold4).

I think it is 0 in the trait data set and O in the community data set.

## COMMUNITY DATA AND ANALYSIS
### DATA

The dataset contains plant community composition data from the TransPlant project vegetation plots along the gradient, OTC and turf transplant experiments. 
The dataset contains the sub-plot frequency, cover, and some performance data on 118 taxa of vascular plants, along with some plot-level predictor variables, in 140 25 x 25 cm vegetation plots.
The dataset covers the years from 2012 to 2016.

### Data collection methods
We recorded all species of vascular plants in each of 25  x 25 cm subplots.
For each species in each subplot it was noted down whether it was present as dominant (covered more than 50% of the sub-plot: D) or a seedling (S). For the  entire 25 x 25 cm plot, the percentage cover of each vascular plant species was then visually estimated. 
Other variables that were measured for each plot:
vegetation height (mean of 5 measurements)
moss % cover
moss layer depth (mean of 5 measurements)
litter % cover 
bare ground % cover
rock % cover
date of analysis
recorder / scribe (if any)
comments
Other variables that were measured for each sub-plot:
moss % cover
litter % cover 
bare % ground cover
rock % cover
Nomenclature follows E-Flora of China. 
Each species of vascular plant was classified by functional type (graminoid, forb, shrub)
