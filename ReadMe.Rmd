## COMMUNITY ANALYSIS
### DATA

The dataset contains plant community composition data from the TransPlant project vegetation plots along the gradient, OTC and turf transplant experiments. 
The dataset contains the sub-plot frequency, cover, and some performance data on 118 taxa of vascular plants, along with some plot-level predictor variables, in 140 25 x 25 cm vegetation plots.
The dataset covers the years from 2012 to 2016.

### Data collection methods
We recorded all species of vascular plants in each of 25  x 25 cm subplots.
For each species in each subplot it was noted down whether it was present as dominant (covered more than 50% of the sub-plot: D) or a seedling (S). For the  entire 25 x 25 cm plot, the percentage cover of each vascular plant species was then visually estimated. 
Other variables that were measured for each plot:
vegetation height (mean of 5 measurements)
moss % cover
moss layer depth (mean of 5 measurements)
litter % cover 
bare ground % cover
rock % cover
date of analysis
recorder / scribe (if any)
comments
Other variables that were measured for each sub-plot:
moss % cover
litter % cover 
bare % ground cover
rock % cover
Nomenclature follows E-Flora of China. 
Each species of vascular plant was classified by functional type (graminoid, forb, shrub)
